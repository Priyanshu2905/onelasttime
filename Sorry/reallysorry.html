    <h1>I know I hurt you all but please read this one for one last timeüíîüíîüíîüíî </h1>
    <p>everything was going well, I was happy in my life but when I was in 8th class an acciedent changed my whole life. It was summer time. My whole family was in village we all were busy in prepration of grandfather's tervi and suddenly one morning we came to know that one member of our family was hospitaliesd due to an accident takes place that morning and that person was my elder brother. We all were shcoked my mother was crying and that was the forst time when I saw her crying. We all prayed for him. He was in very critical condition. His ribbs were broken, his lungs were badly damaged. He was admitted in Baihar's govt hospital there they reffered him to nagpur but unfortunatley he died before we reached to Nagpur. His body came back to the house but this time he was not smiling.. </p>
    <p>I was totaly shocked that time I don't know what had just happened there. That day I was soo quite. Not a single word came out of my mouth. I don't even cried that. Everyone was forcing me see him for the one last time but I didn't saw him.</p>
    <p>From that day I was feeling alone. Even having a lot of friends in my life I was feeling alone. I start keeping distance from others. I always acted normal in front of everyone but didn't share about what's going on inside my mind what I'm feeling from inside. Whenever I was alone I cried and force myself to smile again because now he will not not came to wipe my tears and make me laugh. I started being depressed, now I dont even talk too much in my own house, I acted strangly in house. So one day we went to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-psychiatrist">Psychiatrist</a> Dr.Gyanedndra Jha After visiting there we came to know that what's going wrong with me. But even after knwing the things I'm not able came out of that situation. </p>
    <p>I had lot of friends with whom I can share everything which were running inside my head but I can't. But one day a girl came into my life. She was from Bihar's Sasaram,Bihar. She was my facebook friend. I was very comfortable in sharing things with her. We used to talk for hours without getting bored. She told me all her secrets. We became close friends in very less time. One day during our random conversation she told me she had a hole in her heart and she regularly goes through a critical heart surgery. From that day Whenever she went for operation I used to pray for her. Her brother used to tell me the things that were going on in her operation. After her operation she always asks me that "Agar main kisi dinn vapas nahi aayi toh tu mujhe miss krega?"
    And one day she also left me like my brother left me before. Once again I'm not able to understand that what's going on in my life. Her words were running in my mind.... I started being depressed again.... </p>
    <p>I tried to came out of these om my own again but I didn't. Now I'm doing much more strange things and my parents were worried for me. I start acting like my brother and shows that I'm suffering from many diseases and many more. After seeing this we again went to Psychiatrist and he told us that I was suffering from a mental disorder. So he trated me for a week regularly and instructed me to do the things that makes me happy. Even after the treatement the past memories were  continuesly running in my mind and I was not able to get over it. I came to in relationship for the first time in my life and unfortunatleythat doesnt stand for long we broke up after few days. To be very honest she was a nice girl.....</p>
    <p>I didn't share this before because I thought you don't understand that things and it may runnin my friendship with many of you but I was worng hidding things from you all is my biggest mistake that I had ever made. Many of you want to hit me hard and it's abvious thing I played with your feeling but I didn't do that intentionaly. It spoiled everything..And I know that it's too late now... </p>
